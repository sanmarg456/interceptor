Test Plan for Radford POC interceptor
Test Overview
Objective:
To ensure that the Interceptor accurately captures and relays receipt data from POS systems to the cloud and the printer.
Scope:
Test POS to Interceptor communication.
Verify Interceptor’s data relay to cloud and printer.
Validate compatibility with different connection protocols (USB / RS232).
Requirements:
Raspberry Pi Interceptor set up to intercept and relay data.
POS systems configured to communicate over USB /. RS232.
Cloud storage access to verify data storage.
Receipt printer for printing test receipts.

Test Cases
1. Connection and Communication Setup
1.Test Case ID: TC-001
Description: Verify the connection of the POS system to the Interceptor over USB.
Steps:
Connect the POS to the Interceptor via USB.
Power on the POS and the Interceptor.
Confirm the Interceptor is detected as a printer by the POS.
Expected Result: POS recognizes the Interceptor as a printer without errors.
2.Test Case ID: TC-002
Description: Verify the connection of the Interceptor to the printer over USB/RS232.
Steps:
Connect the Interceptor to the printer via USB/RS232.
Power on the Interceptor and the printer.
Confirm the Interceptor is detected by the printer by sending a signal via interceptor.
Expected Result: The printer recognises the signal from the interceptor  without errors.	

3.Test Case ID: TC-003
Description: Test network connectivity of the Interceptor.
Steps:
      1.Connect the Interceptor to the network.
      2.Confirm that it successfully connects to the cloud storage.
Expected Result: Interceptor successfully connects to the cloud.


2. Receipt Data Capture
Test Case ID: TC-004
Description: Validate receipt data capture from POS over USB/RS232.
Steps:
Initiate a transaction on the POS.
Print a receipt from the POS, connected via USB/RS232.
Expected Result: Interceptor captures and relays receipt data accurately without data loss.

3. Data Relay to Cloud
Test Case ID: TC-005
Description: Verify receipt data transmission to cloud storage.
Steps:
Print a receipt from the POS (via USB or RS232).
Confirm receipt data is stored in the cloud.
Expected Result: Cloud storage contains an accurate copy of the receipt data.
Test Case ID: TC-006
Description: Test delayed cloud storage access.
Steps:
Disconnect network connection to the Interceptor.
Print a receipt from the POS.
Reconnect network and confirm receipt data appears in the cloud.
Expected Result: Receipt data is stored in the cloud once network connectivity resumes.



4. Receipt Printing
Test Case ID: TC-007
Description: Verify print functionality after data interception.
Steps:
Print a receipt from the POS connected to the Interceptor (USB/RS232).
Confirm the receipt is printed accurately by the printer.
Expected Result: Printed receipt matches POS receipt data.


5. Error Handling and Recovery
Test Case ID: TC-008
Description: Test system behaviour when Interceptor loses connection with the POS (USB/RS232).
Steps:
Disconnect USB/RS232 during a transaction.
Reconnect USB/RS232 and attempt to print.
Expected Result: Interceptor resumes functionality and captures the next receipt accurately.

6. Data Validation and Security
Test Case ID: TC-009
Description: Verify that all receipt data stored in the cloud matches printed receipt data.
Steps:
Print several receipts and capture their data in the cloud.
Compare each cloud-stored receipt with the printed copy.
Expected Result: All data matches without discrepancies.
Test Case ID: TC-010
Description: Test secure transmission of receipt data to cloud storage.
Steps:
Capture network traffic from Interceptor to cloud during receipt data transmission.
Confirm data is encrypted (as per specifications).
Expected Result: Data is securely encrypted during transmission.
